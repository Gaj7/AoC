# AoC

My solutions to the Advent of Code programming challenges. 

I'll generally be completing these in languages I want to learn or improve in. I may take this opportunity to learn Rust, or to advance my Haskell skills (ie digging into the standard libraries, pushing myself to do more with higher-order functions, etc. Who knows, I might even learn why the heck Monads are so ubiquitous!)
